Canadian Competitive Programming Association(CCPA) emerged from an ICPC club at the University of Waterloo. Following our passion for competitive programming, we decided to create something bigger than just a club at the university. 

Our mission is to grow and improve the competitive programming scene in Canada. Towards that goal, we plan to host regular competitions and publish practice resources for new and experienced participants.

We are always happy to collaborate towards our goal. Feel free to [contact us](/ccpa/contact)!

<!-- Cool facts about us:

- Ramazan's pull up record is larger than my age.
- The amount of times I beat Ramazan in ping pong is larger than his age.

Boom.
